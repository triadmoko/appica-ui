# Contributing

Appica UI is developed in-house, and we're not accepting feature pull requests at this time. That said, your input genuinely helps the project:

- **Bug reports** are very welcome - please [open an issue](https://github.com/appica-dev/appica-ui/issues) - a small code example that shows the problem helps us fix it much faster.
- **Small fixes** (typos, docs, obvious one-line bugs) are fine as PRs.
- For anything larger, **open an issue first** so we can discuss it before you invest time - unsolicited feature PRs will likely be closed.

## Working on a fix or reproducing an issue locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) >= 9 (`npm install -g pnpm`)

### Setup and common commands

```sh
pnpm install

pnpm build          # build all packages
pnpm test           # run all test suites
pnpm typecheck      # type-check all packages
pnpm lint           # lint all packages
pnpm format         # format the codebase with Prettier
pnpm dev            # watch-rebuild the React package
```

To target a single package, use a filter from the repo root, e.g. `pnpm --filter @appica/ui-react test`. (`dev` is a long-running watcher, so it always targets one package - point it elsewhere with a filter as more packages land.)

## Testing your change visually

Run the playground - a small Vite app wired directly to the library source:

```sh
pnpm playground
```

It serves at `localhost:5173` with hot reload: edit anything under `packages/react/src` and the browser updates instantly (no build step needed). Use `playgrounds/react/src/app.tsx` as your scratch page - drop in the component you're fixing and reproduce the issue there. Import components from the package root (`import { Button } from '@appica/ui-react'`); subpath imports aren't wired up in the playground.

### Repo layout

Framework packages live under `packages/` and are published to npm independently. `packages/react` is the `@appica/ui-react` component library (React 19 + [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) + [Motion](https://motion.dev) + Tailwind CSS v4).

Component conventions (folder layout, exports wiring, testing expectations) are documented in [packages/react/AGENTS.md](packages/react/AGENTS.md). Note that `src/index.ts` and the package.json `exports` map are generated - run `pnpm --filter @appica/ui-react sync-exports` instead of editing them by hand.
